## Additional Notes

This game was originally a submission for the 2020 Harvard May Micro Game Jam. Play the original one on [itch](plankp.itch.io/dodge) or see the microjam-2020 branch.

The [current one](https://plankp.github.io/Dodge/) has several differences:
*  Itch was making mobile support a pain, so now we don't use itch, and mobile (seems) to work.
*  Original one had the playfield fixed at 500px by 500px, we removed that limitation by making it always as big as the screen.
*  Made the sides explicitly black (mainly to account for the playfield size changes)
